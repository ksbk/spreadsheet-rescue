Subject: I can automate your recurring spreadsheet cleanup

Hi {{Name}},

If your team spends hours fixing CSV/XLSX exports before reporting, I can help. I built a local-first workflow that turns messy spreadsheets into a clean Excel report plus QC/manifest artifacts so you can trust the numbers and rerun quickly.

If useful, I can run a sample export and share the before/after output.

Best,
