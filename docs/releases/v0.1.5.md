# spreadsheet-rescue v0.1.5

Release date: 2026-02-15

## Highlights

- Added a dedicated release preflight workflow: `scripts/preflight.sh` and `make preflight`.
- Added one-click demo launchers to the customer demo pack zip for non-technical buyers.

## What’s new for buyers

- `dist/customer-demo-pack.zip` now includes:
  - `dist/RUN_DEMO.command` (macOS)
  - `dist/run_demo.bat` (Windows)
- Buyers can open proof assets immediately: `Final_Report.xlsx`, dashboard PNGs, and audit JSON outputs.

## Developer workflow

- Run `make preflight` before release to execute:
  - lint + typecheck + tests
  - smoke install
  - demo generation
  - customer pack build
  - `mkdocs build --strict`
- Preflight does not bump versions, create commits, or create tags.

## Upgrade notes

- No breaking changes.
- Backwards compatible with existing CLI usage and outputs.
