# spreadsheet-rescue v0.1.1

Release date: 2026-02-13

## Highlights

* Hardened numeric parsing for mixed locale values (`1.200,50`, `200,25`, `1,234.56`) with deterministic behavior.
* Added QC diagnostics for numeric trust:
  * EU decimal-comma detection counters per numeric column
  * ambiguity warnings for values like `1,234` (deterministic fallback, never silent)
* Strengthened duplicate-column contract for `--map`:
  * clear user-facing failure with source provenance
  * QC + manifest emitted on failure, exit code `2`
* Expanded failure contract:
  * unexpected/internal failures now emit QC + manifest and exit code `1`
* Confirmed Excel formula-injection defense:
  * formula-like values are written as literal strings

## Docs and demo

* PRD rewritten as a clear behavioral contract.
* README top section refreshed for customer-first quickstart.
* Added demo pack:
  * `docs/demo/DEMO.md`
  * `examples/input/sample_messy_sales.csv`
  * `scripts/demo.sh`
* Added sales one-pager:
  * `docs/sales/ONE_PAGER.md`

## CI and quality

* Added demo smoke guardrail in CI:
  * runs `./scripts/demo.sh`
  * verifies `Final_Report.xlsx`, `qc_report.json`, and `run_manifest.json`
* Full local quality checks pass:
  * `uv run ruff check src tests`
  * `uv run mypy src/spreadsheet_rescue`
  * `uv run pytest -q`

## Upgrade notes

* No breaking CLI flag changes.
* Exit code contract now explicitly includes `1` for unexpected/internal errors.
